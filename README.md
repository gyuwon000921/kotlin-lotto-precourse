# kotlin-lotto-precourse

# Project Overview
#### - This project is about building a simple lottery ticket generator using Kotlin.
#### - The main goal is not just to write working code, but to write clean, organized code

# Goals
#### - Group related features into classes so that different parts of the program work together naturally.
#### - Write unit tests for each class and function using JUnit 5 and AssertJ.
#### - Apply as much feedback from the Pre-course Week 1 as possible to improve my coding habits.
